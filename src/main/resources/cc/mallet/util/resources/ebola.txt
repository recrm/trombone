New tests show that Ivory Coast did not have its first case of Ebola in more than 25 years after all, the World Health Organization said, reversing course after the reported case last month prompted thousands of vaccines to be deployed.

The initial report sparked fear because the young woman had travelled by bus for several days from Guinea to Ivory Coast, coming into contact with at least 140 people, health officials said.

She eventually made her way to Abidjan, the commercial capital of four million people, before being hospitalized, where a test showed she had Ebola. However, no other suspected cases emerged in the weeks since.

On Tuesday, Ivorian health authorities informed the World Health Organization that a second laboratory, the Institut Pasteur in Lyon, France, had retested those samples "and has found no evidence of the virus."

"With the new results from the laboratory in Lyon, WHO considers that the patient did not have Ebola virus disease and further analysis on the cause of her illness is ongoing," the global health body said in a statement late Tuesday.
